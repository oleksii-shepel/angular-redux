# redux-replique

This library is a compact version of Redux, tailored for Angular applications. It provides a predictable state container, helping you write applications that behave consistently and are easy to test.

## Key Features
1. **Store**: A central object that holds the application state.
2. **Reducers**: Pure functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state.
3. **Actions**: Objects that represent changes to the state.
4. **Modules**: Feature modules with their own state and reducers, which can be loaded lazily.

Action creators and selectors are important parts of Redux-like state management systems.

This library allows you to structure your Angular application in a way that scales well and is easy to understand, similar to how you would with Redux. It supports Action Creators and Selectors, making it even more powerful and flexible. Itâ€™s a great choice for those who want Redux-like behavior without the complexity or size of the full Redux library.
